Same Stripes

You are given an m x n matrix. Your task is to determine if the matrix has diagonal stripes where all elements in each diagonal from top-left to 
bottom-right are of the same stripeâ€”that is, they are identical.

In this context, each diagonal stripe runs from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix. Check if every diagonal stripe 
consists entirely of the same number.

Return True if all diagonal stripes are of the same stripe, otherwise return False.

Example #1
Same Stripe DataLemur Example 1

Input: matrix = [[42, 7, 13, 99], [6, 42, 7, 13], [1, 6, 42, 7]]

Output: True

Explanation:
In this grid, the diagonals are:

[1]
[6, 6]
[42, 42, 42]
[7, 7, 7]
[13, 13]
[99]
All elements in each diagonal ar identical. Thus, the answer is True.

Example #2
Input: matrix = [[8, 23], [69, 1]]

Output: False

![Same Stripe DataLemur Example 2]

Explanation:
The diagonal [8, 1] does not consist of elements of the same stripe.
