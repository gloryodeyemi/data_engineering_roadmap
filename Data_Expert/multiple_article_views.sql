-- Question
-- Using the table playground.views, write a SQL query to identify all viewers who viewed more than one article on the same day. 
-- The table includes columns viewer_id (the ID of the viewer), article_id (the ID of the article viewed), and view_date (the 
-- date of the view). The result should contain a single column named viewer_id, listing each viewer who meets the criteria 
-- without duplicates, and should be sorted in ascending order of viewer_id.

-- These are the tables to query for this question:
-- playground.views
-- article_id int
-- author_id int
-- viewer_id int
-- view_date date

-- Your answer should include these columns:
-- viewer_id integer

-- Solution
SELECT viewer_id
FROM playground.views
GROUP BY view_date, viewer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT article_id) > 1
ORDER BY viewer_id;
