You've been hired by the San Francisco Giants as an analystâ€”congrats! The team's owner wants you to calculate a metric called the run differential 
for each season from the year 2008 to 2012. This metric is calculated by subtracting the total number of runs a team allowed in a season from the 
team's total number of runs scored in a season. 'RS' means runs scored and 'RA' means runs allowed.

The below function calculates this metric:
