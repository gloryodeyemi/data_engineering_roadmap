-- Today's Question:
-- You are tracking your friends' New Yearâ€™s resolution progress. Write a query to calculate the following for each friend: 
-- number of resolutions they made, number of resolutions they completed, and success percentage (% of resolutions completed) 
-- and a success category based on the success percentage:
-- - Green: If success percentage is greater than 75%.
-- - Yellow: If success percentage is between 50% and 75% (inclusive).
-- - Red: If success percentage is less than 50%.

-- Table name: resolutions
-- resolution_id	friend_name	resolution	is_completed
-- 1	Alice	Exercise daily	1
-- 2	Alice	Read 20 books	0
-- 3	Bob	Save money	0
-- 4	Bob	Eat healthier	1
