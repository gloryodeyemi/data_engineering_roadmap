-- App Download Conversion Rates by Category

/*
You are on the Google Play store's App Marketplace team. You and your team want to understand how different app categories convert from browsing 
to actual downloads. This analysis is critical in informing future product placement and marketing strategies for app developers and users.

Question 1 of 3
The marketplace team wants to identify high and low performing app categories. Provide the total downloads for the app categories for November 
2024. If there were no downloads for that category, return the value as 0.

/*
Question 2
Our team's goal is download conversion rate â€” defined as downloads per browse event. For each app category, calculate the download conversion rate 
in December, removing categories where browsing counts are zero.
